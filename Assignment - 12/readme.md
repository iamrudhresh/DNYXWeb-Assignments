# Fetch and Display Bacon Ipsum Data with Modern Async/Await Syntax

This assignment involves creating a web application that fetches data from the [Bacon Ipsum API](https://baconipsum.com/api/?type=all) using the Fetch API and modern async/await syntax, and displays it on a webpage.

## Requirements

### 1. Create HTML Structure
- Set up a basic HTML structure with an appropriate layout for displaying the fetched data.
- Include HTML elements to showcase the fetched data.

### 2. Fetch Bacon Ipsum Data Using Fetch API (GET method) and Async/Await:
- Write JavaScript code to fetch data from the Bacon Ipsum API using the Fetch API and modern async/await syntax.
- Utilize the `fetch` function with `await` to make a GET request to the Bacon Ipsum API endpoint: `https://baconipsum.com/api/?type=all`.

### 3. Display Fetched Data
- Update the HTML elements dynamically to display the bacon ipsum text fetched from the API.
- Choose creative ways to present the data, such as creating a paragraph, list, or any format you prefer.

### 4. Handle Errors with Async/Await:
- Implement error handling for the fetch operation using modern async/await syntax.
- Use `try...catch` to handle any errors that may occur during the fetch.

### 5. Styling
- Apply CSS styling to enhance the visual appeal of the fetched data on the webpage.
- Ensure a responsive design that works well on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Submission Guidelines

- Organize your code with proper indentation and comments for clarity.
- Include a README file explaining how to run your application.
- If you use any external libraries or frameworks, mention them in the README along with installation instructions.

## Bonus

- Add a button or a feature to dynamically refresh the bacon ipsum text.
- Implement a loading indicator to inform users that data is being fetched.
